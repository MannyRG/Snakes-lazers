### Instruction

* You Can move your snake freely in any drirrection or stay stationary
* the length of your snake is limit less,
* Th twist is that you have lazers trying to shoot you down
* You lso have a secondary person trying to beat

## Overview

ThA SnAke GAme is just a good way of taking somthing classic and adding a twist to it.
The Game fetures a snake game two player, somthing most Snake Games don't, and also the games fetures obsticuls.
curretly the obsticals wont do any damage or end the game but the player wont "Know that".

There are simple rules eat the fruit and reach 100 points before the other player, the third rules is DON'T TOUCH THE LAZERS but they wont do anything, the third rule is so that the player can be tricked and struggle to eat the fruit with out touching the lazers.

### Future,
My team and i are going to continue working on adding more fetures like
diffrent types of obsticals, More players, take player point by eating there tails,
this can become somthing simalare to slither.io
